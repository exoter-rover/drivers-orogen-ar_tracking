# header, and this header will be loaded here

# Finally, it is pretty common that headers are directly loaded from an external
# library. In this case, the library must be first used (the name is the
# library's pkg-config name) and then the header can be used. Following Rock
# conventions, a common use-case would be:
#
# using_library "ar_tracking"
# import_types_from "ar_tracking/CustomType.hpp"

# If this project uses data types that are defined in other oroGen projects,
# these projects should be imported there as well.
# import_types_from "base"

#
# The corresponding C++ class can be edited in tasks/Task.hpp and
# tasks/Task.cpp, and will be put in the ar_tracking namespace.
